# PTU_Reader
[ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)/[FIJI](http://fiji.sc/) plugin reading PicoQuant ptu/pt3 FLIM TTTR image files.

It is based/upgraded from [Pt3Reader](http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:inputoutput:picoquant_.pt3_image_reader:start) plugin developed by FranÃ§ois Waharte and [Matlab code](https://github.com/PicoQuant/PicoQuant-Time-Tagged-File-Format-Demos/blob/master/PTU/Matlab/Read_PTU.m) from PicoQuant.

## How to install plugin

1. You need to download and install [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html) or [FIJI](http://fiji.sc/#download) on your computer first.
2. [Download](https://github.com/ekatrukha/PTU_Reader/blob/master/PTU_Reader_0.0.2_.jar?raw=true) *PTU_Reader_...jar* and place it in the "plugins" folder of ImageJ/FIJI.
3. Plugin will appear as *PTU_Reader* in ImageJ's *Plugins* menu.

## How to run plugin

1. Click *PTU_Reader* line in ImageJ's *Plugins* menu.
2. In "Open File" dialog choose file with (ptu/pt3) extension to load.
3. Plugin will read file's header and provide you with following options:  
![Menu](http://katpyxa.info/software/PTU_Reader/Menu2.png "Menu") 
4. Choose what images/stacks you want to load (see detailed description below) and click *OK*.

## Output #1: lifetime ordered stack

This is 8-bit stack containing 4096 frames. Each frame corresponds to a lifetime value. Why 4096? It is number of time registers in PicoQuant module. To get real time value in nanoseconds (ns), you need to know frequency of laser pulses during acquisition. Suppose laser frequency is 40MHz. That means distance between pulses is 1/40x10^6 = 25 ns. That means this period is splitted by 4096 intervals, i.e. time difference between frames = 25/4096 ~ 6.1 picoseconds (ps, 10^-12).

The intensity of pixel at *x*,*y* position corresponds to the number of photons with this lifetime during the *whole acquisition*.  
Don't forget to do *Image->Adjust->Brightness/Contrast* to see the signal.

For example, to get a FLIM decay curve of some image area that would look like this:  
![Curve example](http://katpyxa.info/software/PTU_Reader/Curve_example.png "curve")  

select rectangular ROI and go to *Image->Stacks->Plot Z-axis profile*. You can make plot *y*-axis logarithmic by clicking *More>>Set Range..* 

In addition, there are two loading options: "*Load whole stack*" and "*Load binned*". First option assembles all photons in one stack with 4096 frames (lifetimes). "Load binned" creates Hyperstack where z coordinate corresponds to 4096-format lifetime, while "*time*" corresponds to binned frame intervals specified by "*Bin size in frames*" parameter below. Last option can generate HUGE files (since imagewidth x imageheight x 4096 x binned frames), so be aware about it.

If you choose "*Load only frame range*" option at the bottom of the dialog, it will also restrict detected photons to the specified range.

## Output #2: Intensity and Lifetime Average stacks
Lifetime acquisition often happens over multiple frames. If this option is checked in the menu, plugin will provide intensity stack for each frame (if binning is 1) or summarized intensity of multiple frames for the bin size larger than 1.  

In addition, for the same number of binned frames, it will generate average lifetime value map.  
**Important**: the lifetime value is in the same 4096 register format! Use the same math/laser frequency recalculation to get value in nanoseconds. Whole image/stack math can be done using ImageJ *Process->Math* options.

So you can observe average lifetime change during acquisition. It is recommended to you different LUT to highlight its changes (*Image->Lookup Tables->Spectrum* or *Rainbow RGB*)

These two stacks are in 32-bit format.

You can restrict the interval of loaded data by selecting "*Load only frame range*" checkbox and providing the range of frames to load.

## It can not read my files! What about pt2? There is error!
Send me example of your file by email, describe the problem and I'll try to incorporate it to the plugin.

## Updates history
v.0.0.4 Thanks to Bruno Scocozza feedback, frame marker bug during loading is fixed now. Plus, "frame range" and lifetime binning options are added.
v.0.0.2 file dialog changed to system default (now works on Mac, no need in java library).
